Welcome to my personal site source code. The live site is (hopefully!) [here](https://jpaddison.net/).

The purpose of this site was mostly in the making. I got to write my own [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) code, learn the [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) framework, and sommmewhat learn [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Some of this is clearly over-engineered, other parts are terrible hacks.

## Frontend (Mianju)

The frontend is written in typescript using the [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) frameworks.

## API (Ziwo)

Only used for the Guest Book `/api` routes. This was written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), using [actix](https://actix.rs/) and [diesel](http://diesel.rs/).

## Deployment

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) man, would not recommend for your personal site. I guess it was fine.
